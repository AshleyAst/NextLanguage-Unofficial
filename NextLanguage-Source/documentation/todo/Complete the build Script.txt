## Builder Installation

For the new builder, we will be renaming all 
configuration id patches for NextLanguage v1.7.0 
to .config and their respective function for better 
fs writing formats for future updated releases. 

NextLanguage Unofficial will be posting it's first 
release soon this month on June. Which will be 
v1.7.0 And will be releasing more updates to support it. 

For the /lib/ folder, we will now be using it for 
exporting and logging new custom upcoming Revamped NextLanguage Engine. 
Which will be compiling new code from it's own 
parsers and lexers to Javascript.
