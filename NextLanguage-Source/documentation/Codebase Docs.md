# Codebase for NextLanguage
Current Patch Builder is currently being <br>
developed for NextLanguage Unofficial v1.7.0 <br>
<br>
The long awaited Security Codebase is being <br>
worked on, and will be published into the <br>
source code of this unofficial version of <br>
NextLanguage. Later this month on June. <br>
<br>
NextLanguage will now being using NextLibrary Unofficial <br>
for logging menus and log files. <br>
<br>
NextLanguage Unofficial's Source code will now <br>
have an Codespace Source Code for the complete <br>
build of NextLanguage, with all of the files <br>
you're going to be using from the release pages. <br>
<br>
NextLanguage's /app/ folder will now be worked on <br>
for future applications generations. An Upcoming <br>
revamp of the Parser and Lexer, including the new <br>
NextLanguage Unofficial's Interpreter will now be <br>
worked on for custom coding, instead of using the <br>
built in Javascript code as the template. <br>
<br>

#### **Builder Installation** <br>
For the new builder, we will be renaming all <br>
configuration id patches for NextLanguage v1.7.0 <br>
to .config and their respective function for better <br>
fs writing formats for future updated releases. <br>
<br>
NextLanguage Unofficial will be posting it's first <br>
release soon this month on June. Which will be <br>
v1.7.0 And will be releasing more updates to support it. <br>
<br>
For the /lib/ folder, we will now be using it for <br>
exporting and logging new custom upcoming Revamped NextLanguage Engine. <br>
Which will be compiling new code from it's own <br>
parsers and lexers to Javascript. <br>
<br>

#### **Custom Language Codebases** <br>
NextLanguage Unofficial, will also be allowing <br>
support for coding in multiple languages, to <br>
be able to run the new custom compiler in a <br>
different language, native to the user's country. <br>
<br>

#### **Build ID Revamp** <br>
NextLanguage Unofficial will now be revamping <br>
the ID system to be hardcoded in, so that every <br>
function will require an ID system to run so that <br>
an function from a future version won't work for <br>
older versions. So that no weird issues with <br>
backwards systems will occur. <br>
<br>
Bypassing this system is possible, but we do <br>
not recommend bypass this ID check to run, as it could <br>
cause weird compatibility issues. <br>
<br>

### Codebase Reviews
In this Unofficial Version of NextLanguage, we will <br>
explain every single function and file, for NextLangauge <br>
and what's it's used for, and why should we need it. <br>
<br>

<h4 style="color: darkorange">CURRENT REVIEW IS UNAVAILABLE</h4>
I've not currently have time to make an review for this codebase
for now. I'll be making one later this month, I'm thinking.
